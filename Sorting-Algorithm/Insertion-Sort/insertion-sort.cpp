/*

Insertion Sort:
    - It is a simple sorting algorithm that works by building a sorted array one element
    at a time. It is considered an "in-place" sorting algorithm, meaning it doesn't require
    any additional memory space beyond teh original array.

Time Complexity:
    - Best Case: O(n)
    - Average Case: O(n^2)
    - Worst Case: O(n^2)

Space Complexity =  O(1)
